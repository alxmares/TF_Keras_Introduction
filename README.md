# Introduction to TensorFlow with Keras

Welcome to our repository, dedicated to providing a comprehensive introduction to TensorFlow in conjunction with Keras. I aim to offer a clear and professional exploration of TensorFlow and Keras, covering a wide range of topics from the very basics to more advanced applications as artificial vision.

## Overview

TensorFlow, developed by the Google Brain team, is an open-source machine learning framework that provides a flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources. It allows for the easy development of machine learning models. Keras, on the other hand, is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow. It enables fast experimentation with deep neural networks, focusing on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible.

## What You Will Learn

- **Basic Concepts**: 

- **Back and Forward Propagation**: 

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: 

- **Artificial Vision Examples**: 

## Getting Started

To get started, ensure you have the latest version of Python installed on your system. Follow the installation guides for TensorFlow and Keras from their official documentation:

- [TensorFlow Installation Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
- [Keras Installation Guide](https://keras.io/getting_started/intro_to_keras_for_engineers/)

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming.
- Familiarity with linear algebra, calculus, and statistics, though we will provide refreshers on these topics as needed.
- An interest in machine learning and neural networks.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository is structured to guide you through each concept and application in a logical progression. Begin with the introductory materials on tensors, then move on to learning about back and forward propagation, and progressively delve into more complex topics like CNNs and artificial vision applications.

- **Examples and Code Snippets**: For practical learning, we provide examples and code snippets that you can run on your own machine. These examples are designed to reinforce the concepts discussed in each section.

- **Exercises and Challenges**: To test your understanding, we offer exercises and challenges at the end of each major section. These will help solidify your knowledge and provide hands-on experience with TensorFlow and Keras.

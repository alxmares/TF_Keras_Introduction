## Contents

- **Numpy**: We'll learn how to handle arrays and perform essential mathematical operations for data processing.
- **Pandas**: We'll explore how to load, manipulate, and analyze data efficiently with DataFrames.
- **Matplotlib**: We'll discover how to visualize our data, a key skill for any data analysis or Machine Learning project.
- **Deep Learning Example with Tensorflow and Keras**: We'll put into practice what we've learned by building a basic Deep Learning model to solve a specific problem.

Each section includes practical examples and code that you can run, modify, and explore on your own.

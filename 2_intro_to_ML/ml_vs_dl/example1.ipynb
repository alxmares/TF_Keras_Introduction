These examples will highlight the difference in complexity, approach, and capability between ML and DL."

In contrast, the DL example constructs a neural network with multiple layers and neurons, showing a more complex and flexible setup, ideal for more complex data or where the relationships between features are not linear.\n",

However, the advantage of neural networks becomes more evident in more complex problems with large data volumes and high dimensionality, where DL's feature learning capability can significantly outperform traditional ML methods."
